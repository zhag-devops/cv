#### Senior DevOps Engineer, DevOps Team Lead, Junior System Architect 
Yerevan, Armenia

I have spent the last 7 years in various roles at B2broker LTD.

### About company
B2broker is a Global Prime of Prime Multi-Asset Liquidity & Technology White Label solutions provider for Brokerages and Exchanges.

### About me
I am interested in software development and have knowledge about the differences between authorization and authentication, 12 factor apps, CORS issues, OAuth, WS, GRPC, and queues. However, I come from a system administrator background and don`t have experience in production development as a software developer. 

I left B2broker at the end of 2022 due to burnout and have taken a break since that time. I`m currently looking for a new job.
